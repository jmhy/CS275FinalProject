('Bench Press', '<p><b>Step 1:</b> Lie on your back on a flat bench. Lift the bar off the rack and hold it straight over you, keeping your arms locked. This is the starting position.</p>
<p><b>Step 2:</b> Next, inhale and bring the barbell down in a slow and controlled manner until it reaches your mid-chest.</p>
<p><b>Step 3:</b> Pause briefly before raising the barbell back to your starting position as you exhale. Your focus should be on using your chest muscles to move the bar. Lock your arms at the top of the movement and squeeze your chest before slowly bringing the barbell down again. This step should take twice as long raising the weight to get the maximum benefit.</p>
<p><b>Step 4:</b> Repeat the movement for the desired number of repetitions.</p>
<p><b>Step 5:</b> The final step in the exercise is to place the barbell on the rack.</p>', 4, 12, 14);
